We use histogram + size bias to predict.
There are 8 groups.
We will predict 10000000 subsets.
The bias size we use is from ../tasks/task2/SizeBias/plan1/Thu Feb 17 16:26:41 2022/bias_size0.pickle and so on.
The metric we use is l1_distance.
The result of each group as fellow:
1.2609391613127325
1.1899723603613226
