We use histogram + size bias to predict.
There are 8 groups.
We will predict 10000000 subsets.
The bias size we use is from ../tasks/task3/SizeBias/plan1/Sun Apr 10 00_09_49 2022/bias_size0.pickle and so on.
The metric we use is l1_distance.
The result of each group as fellow:
0.7011374854711787
0.8344805490092988
0.8807951599767387
