We use histogram + size bias to predict.
There are 8 groups.
We will predict 10000000 subsets.
The bias size we use is from ../tasks/task1/SizeBias/plan1/Fri Feb 11 21:54:55 2022/bias_size0.pickle and so on.
The metric we use is l1_distance.
The result of each group as fellow:
1.064850519177331
0.9746180620695919
0.8672035265552986
