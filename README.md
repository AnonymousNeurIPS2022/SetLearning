# SetLearning

This project is the source code of "Sequential to Set and Set Neural Networks" Submitted to 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).

You need python to run it. Pytorch, networkx, numpy are needed.

"utility": 
  util.py: contains some useful function.
  metric.py: contains a function to calculate L1-distance.
  
"SizeBias":
  plan1.py: output the sizebias array by plan1.
  
"Baseline": baseline method
  
"DCM": method form paper "A Discrete Choice Model for Subset Selection"

"RW": method form paper "Representation Learning for Predicting Customer Orders", the file randomwalk_fast_neighborhood_v3.py is copy form thier source code.
